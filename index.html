      <h2>Hello.</h2>

        <h3>Digital Marketing</h3>
        <p>Having started influencing by the age of 15, I have had a great deal of experience with the online world. Although influencing has taught me a lot, it's great to have seen it from the other side too. I worked in PR for a year during covid meaning a lot of our marketing was based online. I have now ventured in website development and social media management due to my master's program which has given me even more experience in this industry.</p>

        <h3>Photography & Graphic Design</h3>
        <p>Influencing has given me experience with photography and photoshop programmes resulting in an understanding of photography skills and editing. The experience I have gained through social media management has led to me developing graphic design skills which can influence customers through social media. </p>
